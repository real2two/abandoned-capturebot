Note: This is one of my abandoned Discord bots I decided to release.

I know there's some questionable decisions I made (ex. like I didn't know you could do [this](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js/tree/main/packages/core#independent-rest-api-usage) with Discord.JS's REST API), but this is just some stuff I've been making for fun.

This project wasn't meant to be serious at all, but more of a personal project to take a break from bigger projects.

The README is a bit very misleading and there isn't any "catching users". This is more of an autoclicker but there's a map where you can go forwards, left and right.
